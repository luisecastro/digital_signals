# Digital Signal Processing

Here are a set of tools for performing digital signal analysis.

- digital_signals_processing.ipynb: explores sampling, Fourier transforms, windowing, filters, aliasing, zero padding, spectrograms, classification and spectral power density.
- phone_encode_decode_tones.ipynb: Is a toy implementation of the coding/decoding of tones over the telephone line.
- bird_sound_exploration.ipynb: explores bird sounds and differentiates from other environmental sounds.
- signal_noise.ipynb: A brief apporach to signal / noise.
